# Python-basics
The following  topics are covered : 1. Data types  2. Conditional statements 3.  Iterators 4. Exception handling  

PYTHON  BASICS

Python - high -level interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability - open source - includes 			large standard library

Key features - easy to read syntax, dynamic typing ,automatic memory management, extensive standard library , support 					multi programming paradigm

Applications - web development, data science & machine learning, data analysis, scientific computing , operating 						system, game development

Module  -  file containing python code which includes class, function and variables. they allow code reuse and 						organization, making it see to maintain larger projects 

Package  -  way to organize related modules into directory hierarchy - allows logical grouping of modules 

Comment   -  Comments are denoted by # character - in lines are code if a line is commented which means  it will be 	
				ignored by an interpreter

Variables - temporary storage place 

Function  - reusable block of code which perform a specific task 

Algorithm - step by step approach to find the solution


DATA TYPES 

1. Integer - 1,85,23578, -6372

2. Float - 0.678,5.76, -9.543, - 2488.99

3. String - "123","hello","hello123","123hello",'apple','orange'

4. Boolean - True, False

5. Tuple - ordered collection enclosed in  (), immutable(not changeable)
               tup_1 = (1,'a',True,3.14)

6. List - ordered collection enclosed in [], mutable 
             list_1 = [1,"hello","world",True,3.14]

7. Dictionary - unordered collection enclosed in {}, denoted in key value pairs, mutable
			dict_1 = {'apple': 50,'orange': 40, 'banana': 30 }

8. Set - unordered and unindexed collection of elements enclosed in {}, no duplicates  
			set_1 = {"1","hello","hello"} // {'1','hello'}

TYPE CONVERSION - Type casting, process of converting one data type into another

CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS - if,elif,else - allow you to perform operation based on certain conditions

LOOPS - for and while loop allows to execute a block of code repeatedly

EXCEPTION -  are events that occur during execution of program that disrupts the normal flow of code - handled by 
              try- except block

Lambda - is an anonymous function that can be defined in  a single line - can have multiple arguments but one function 				expression
map(function, iterable) -The map() function iterates through all items in the given iterable and executes the function we passed as an argument on each of them

filter(function, iterable)- similar to map iterates through the all items for given function and return a new list

reduce -  returns a single value- not like map and filter

join -  method takes all items in an iterable and joins them into one string
        
split(separator, maxsplit) - split a string into a list

strip()  -   delete all the leading and trailing characters mentioned in its argument

lstrip()  - delete all the leading characters mentioned in its argument

rstrip() -  delete all the trailing characters mentioned in its argument
